# ADAC (Aresty Distributed Average Consensus)

This project was supported by the Aresty Center for Undergraduate Research at Rutgers University during the spring 2016-17 AY

Working with Dr. Waheed Bajwa, we created an implementation of Distributed average consensus.

This respository houses the code we built to test and experiment with consensus using MPI vs a pure-TCP approach.
